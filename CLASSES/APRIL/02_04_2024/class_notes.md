## SCALE OUT AS NEEDED

NUMBER OF REQUESTS IS NOT CONSTANT OVER TIME

FOR INUMEROUS REASONS, WE CAN GET HUGE UNPREDICTABLE SPIKES

EXAMPLE:

- NETPA
- BIGBLUEBUTTON

HOW BIG TECHS HANDLE SPIKES OF ACCESS, A GOOD EXAMPLE IS WHEN COVID 19 HAPPENED\
YOUTUBE AND NETFLIX REDUCED THEIR STREAM QUALITY TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC

### SLASHDOT EFFECT

OCCURS WHEN A POPULAR WEBSITE LINKS TO A SMALLER WEBSITE, CAUSING A MASSIVE INCREASE IN TRAFFIC.\
THIS OVERLOADS THE SMALLER SITE, CAUSING IT TO SLOW DOWN OR EVEN TEMPORARILY BECOME UNAVAILABLE.

### HOW TO SCALE OUT JUST IN TIME

- START OR STOP ONE OF THE APPLICATION INSTANCES

IN TRADITIONAL APPLICATIONS HOSTED IN PHYSICAL HARDWARE, IT IS EASIER TO DEAL WITH HANDLING LOAD.\
WHEN IN CLOUD BASED SCENARIO, WE MIGHT WANT IT ALL TO BE FULLY AUTOMATED.\
INSTANCES HAVE DYNAMICALLY ASSIGNED NETWORK LOCATIONS.\
INSTANCES MAY CHANGE DYNAMICALLY.\

- AUTO SCALING
- FAILURES AND RECOVERIES
- UPGRADES
