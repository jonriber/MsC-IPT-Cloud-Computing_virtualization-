## CLOUD COMPUTING

"THERE IS NO CLOUD, IT´S JUST SOMEONE ELSE´S COMPUTER"

### ARCHTECTURE

PROFESSOR EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL ARCHTECTURE AND \
VIRTUALIZATION AND NOW CLOUD COMPUTING.

### WHAT DOES IT FIX?

USING OR MOVING YOUR SERVICES TO THE CLOUD SOLVES A MAJOR ISSUE RELATED WITH PEAK TIME AGAINST \
REQUESTS. DURING THE DAY, YOUR APP USAGE GRAPH CAN VARY A LOT, WITH NO OR MINIMAL USAGE AT THE MORNING \
AND THEN A HUGE PEAK OF REQUESTS DURING A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME.

THAT´S WHERE CLOUD IS USEFUL. FOLLOWING THIS SCENARIO, WE DON´T NEED COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES IN THE MORNING,\
JUST IN OUR PEAK PERIOD, AND WE NEED IT FAST AND IN FULL POWER.

SO, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS PAY FOR ALL COMPATIONAL RESOURCE NEEDED DURING THAT SPECIFIC TIME, AND THEN SHUT IT DOWN.
