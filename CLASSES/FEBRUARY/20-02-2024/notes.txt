# WHY CLOUD? WHY VIRTUALIZATION?

    ## TRADITIONAL SERVER ARCHTECTURE
        - APPS RUN ON BARE-METAL SERVERS
        E.G: UBUNTU, NIINX, POSTGRESQL, PUMA, REDIS, LIBRARIES, LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS AND OTHER TOOLS

        WHEN TALKING ABOUT OPERATIVE SYSTEMS, DRIVERS ARE OFTEN A BRIDGE BETWEEN HARDWARE AND THE OS

    ANALOGY FOR WHAT CLOUB COMPUTING STANDS FOR:
        - IN THE PAST, EVERY TOWN, HAD A SINGLE SOURCE OF WATER, LIKE A WATER PIT. IT WAS LIKE THAT WHEN USING TRADITIONAL ARCHTECTURE. NOW, WE HAVE PIPES,
        AND EVERY HOUSE CAN TURN AND CONSUME WHENEVER THEY WANT, JUST BY TAPPING ON AND THE WATER FLOWS.
